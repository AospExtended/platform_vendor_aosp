      "message": "Shouldn\u0027t it be taken care of in settings, since this seems a resource from aosp itself and I see the actual card colour has been overridden in values-night, so most probably this must be color of the shadow in the dismissal UI, even in light theme by default it uses @*android:color/material_grey_100 which means it is supposed to look greyish in light theme. Also I am not getting that why are we adding this overlay only for apps build, contextual cards are part of settings in all type of builds right?",
